## General info
This project is made to check if a recipie is OK for people on low FODMAP diet.
Users can add their own products, or links to recipies they like to check the safety of them.
They can make their collections and save recipies added by others.
For now it works for English and Polish ingredients.
I'm still working on tihs project, with many enhancements planned.
